This program performs spline fitting <br />
Major Features: <br />
1. Monotonic spline fitting <br />
2. Non-monotonic spline fitting (first degree complexity enclosed shapes possible) <br />
3. Ability to solve large amount of anchor points (solves derivative function with row compressed storage matrix format) <br />
4. Anchor points can be created by reading csv files.
